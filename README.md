# RHodor Palettes 

**Hodor**, named initially Wylis, was a servant of House Stark at Winterfell, loyal to Bran Stark. Hodor was one of the most underestimated characters in **Game of Thrones** and provided one of the most memorable episodes of the series **("The Door")**, arguably better than the series finale!! <br />
